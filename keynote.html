  <p class="body">Dr. Müge Andac is an Associate Professor at the University of Hacettepe in the Department of Environmental Engineering at Environmental Technology Division. She carried out a part of her research on cryogels at Lund University in 2007 and gained her Ph.D. degree in 2009 from the University of Hacettepe on application of cryogels to affinity and molecular recognition based chromatographic separation methods. Her current research interests are the synthesis and characterization of molecular imprinted based polymers, micro/nano-materials, super-macroporous hydrogels, composite materials, and their applications to bioassays, sensors, and chromatographic systems in the field of affinity recognition of biomolecules and environmental pollutants.</p>
